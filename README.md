# Arduino-Potentiometer-Controlled-Servo-Motor

As the title suggests, this project sets up a sero motor that moves from 0 to 180 degrees along with the movement of a potentiometer.
The potentiometer adjusts the Pulse Width Modulation output between 0 and 5V from the Arduino. This value is then equated to an angle between 0 and 179 degrees (0V = 0 degrees, 5V = 179 degrees).
